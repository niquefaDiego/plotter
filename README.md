# Plotter

I'll try to make a tool to easily plot geometric figures, starting with polygons.

# Development setup

Install node dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Run in watch mode:
```
npm run dev
```

This will run the webpage in: http://localhost:5000
And bunle analyzer in: http://localhost:8888

# Production setup

```
npm i
npm run build
```

The distribution files will be in the `dist/prod` folder.

# Deployment

Changes to main branch will be automatically deployed to: https://niquefa-plotter.netlify.app
